PirateProxy v0.4
==============================================================================

- Welcome
Welcome to PirateProxy, a Python-based generic HTTP/HTTPS web proxy. This proxy
works in a different way than standard HTTP proxies such as Squid and Varnish.
Users do not need to configure their browser proxy configurations.  Instead,
this proxy can be visited like any other website. For example, if this proxy is
installed as 'http://proxy.example.org', users can go to that URL with
their browser and enter the site they want to proxy.  The proxy then requests
that site and ensures that users continue to browse through the proxy. The
proxy uses URLs such as 'http://www.google.com.proxy.example.org'.

This proxy supports HTTP and HTTPS and can be used to visit both IPv4 and IPv6
web sites, although it is not possible to surf to IPv6 IP addresses.

The proxy is written in Python, but uses a HTML parser written in C. Possibly
it can be made to run on Windows, but so far only Linux and FreeBSD have been
tested and are known to work.

Be aware that this is still alpha-quality software which was written in a short
time period. 


- Rationale
This proxy was written by the Dutch Pirate Party (http://www.piratenpartij.nl/)
in response to increasing censorship in the world and in The Netherlands to
allow users to access otherwise blocked websites using the proxy. 

Although there is other software serving this purpose available, the
scalability and performance of these solutions was found to be insufficient and
needed features were not available.

 
- Dependencies
The Pirate Proxy depends on a few software packages. 

For the Python-based Proxy itself:
- Python (2.7 works)
- The `ipy' module

For the C-based HTML parser and Python wrapper:
- Cython


- Installation
Install the dependencies first. To be able to build the HTML parser used by the
proxy, you will need to have a working C compiler, autoconf, automake and 
Cython. 

First, build and install the streamhtmlparser:
# cd streamhtmlparser
# ./configure
# make

As root:
# make install

And the Python wrapper:

# cd ../streamhtmlparser/src/py-streamhtmlparser
# make

As root:
# make install

Create a user with limited rights to run the proxy as and copy the pirateproxy
sub-directory to your prefered location.


NOTE: The HTML parser library and Python wrapper are installed in /usr/local.
On some systems this appears not to work out-of-the-box. A possible fix
is:
# cp /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/* /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
# ldconfig -v


- Configuration
All configuration is done through the proxy.conf configuration file. A default
configuration file is supplied. 

The most important settings are:

http_listen_port, https_listen_port: The HTTP and HTTPS ports the proxy will 
listen on. You can configure the listen ports to be 80 and 443 and let
users access the proxy directly. You can also place a reverse proxy in-front
of the Pirate Proxy. In that case, the listen ports should be different.

http_port, https_port: These are the ports the proxy is reachable on from the
outside. They may be different from the listen addresses, for example in case 
of a reverse proxy in front. 

https_certificate: A PEM file that contains the Pirate Proxy SSL certificate,
if necessary an intermediate CA certificate and the private key.

hostname: The hostname the Pirate Proxy is reachable on. Please be aware
that a wildcard DNS entry is needed to ensure that any subdomain 'below'
this hostname points to the same system. For instance:
proxy.example.com IN A 192.0.2.15
*.proxy.example.com IN A 192.0.2.15

block_robots: If you want to ensure that web spiders/crawlers do not try to 
crawl the entire internet through your proxy, you can set this setting to 'yes'.

Under the section [rewrites] you can add custom rewrites for specific 
hostnames. The syntax is hostname=newhostname. For instances, if you want to
ensure that 'http://www.example.org/' does not pass through the proxy,
you could create the following rewrite:
www.example.org=www.example.org

You can also rewrite a specific hostname to pass through a different
proxy:
www.example.org=www.example.org.proxy2.example.com

As a final configuration step, you will need to edit the 'index.html' file
found in the 'html' directory. Change the example hostname found in that
file to your selected hostname. Of course you can also apply style changes,
put a different logo on the page, etcetera.

- Execution
To execute the program, run ./Proxy.py -c proxy.conf. For now, the proxy does
not daemonize and you are responsible for writing a start-up script.
